Ambush is a People Company. But what does that mean exactly? It means we care about our people as much as we care about building great products. We take a human-centered approach to identifying, retaining, and integrating highly-talented, long-term remote people into America’s best product and development team.

We began our consulting journey in 2015 and have been growing ever since! We do that by delivering the best quality work possible for our clients. We are not afraid to take risks and we always seek the best possible path to solve a problem, instead of just a quick makeshift solution. Thanks to our highly skilled team of engineers, we always perform tasks using our best abilities!

We are passionate about what we do every day and we can always count on our team to have our backs. Teamwork is one of our core values! We don’t go anywhere by ourselves. We are driven to achieve great things. And we are extremely helpful to everyone. We expect you to be a team player.

At Ambush, we have different initiatives to help you increase your knowledge and skills. Here you will be part of an English-speaking environment and work in a place where sharing knowledge is a core value! To exemplify it, we have an English Immersion moment for you to enhance your vocabulary and pronunciation. And we also have a special moment for people to present and share knowledge with their colleagues. These are a few examples of our dynamism when the subject is knowledge sharing!

### When you join us, you will:

- Collaborate with experienced multidisciplinary teams to build high-quality applications and features.
- Identify areas of improvement and drive software best practices.
- Communicate in English on a daily basis, both written and verbally.
- Share knowledge with coworkers passionate about coding and learning new things.

### What we'd like to see in a candidate:

- Hands-on experience with Swift and SwiftUI and maintaining existing codebases.
- Someone who can bring a positive attitude and innovative mindset to tackle complex tasks and turn them into successful outcomes.
- Someone who can thrive in demanding situations and demonstrate resilience while working on projects that present unique difficulties.
- Strong willingness to help others, open-mindedness, and passion for coding.
- Passion for good programming practices, continuous learning, and experience with CI/CD.
- Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills.
- Ability to work both independently and in a team-oriented, collaborative environment.
